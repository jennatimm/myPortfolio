            creative direction. While others might have been driven by the predefined extra credit 
            opportunities, I chose to focus on design features that interested me personally and 
            challenged my understanding of the application structure. Which I found pushed me to 
            think more deeply about how to organize and structure the program. I implemented the full 
            MVC pattern myself, creating separate classes for the model, view, controller, utility 
            functions, and testing. In total, the project included six classes: one for each component 
            plus two utility helpers."
            text2="One of the more difficult aspects was fully separating the view and controller, as 
            most of our previous assignments had combined the two. Later, our instructor explained that 
            in smaller projects, the controller often just initializes the GUI, validating the simpler 
            structure I had adopted."/>

            text="Before this assignment, frontend development wasnâ€™t something I gravitated toward since 
            I saw it as mostly visual. It was not something I thought would be challenging or rewarding. 
            But once I started this project, I realized how much thought goes into designing something 
            intuitive and user-friendly. It was a challenge to guess all the different ways someone might 
            experience or interact with my game. It pushed me to think critically about design decisions 
            and build a more robust, thoughtful application. When my next project involved a GUI, I 
            immediately volunteered. I even took the initiative to self teach myself JavaFX so I could 
            continue growing in this space."
