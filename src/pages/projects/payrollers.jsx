            web application that involved designing and developing a dynamic website using PHP 
            with a SQL relational database for efficient data management. We handled everything 
            from the initial design to the final deployment. Originally, It was launched it on 
            Google Cloud Platform, but after the trial ended, I migrated it to InfinityFree. 
            This project gave me hands on experience with full-stack development, database 
            design, cloud deployment, and effective team collaboration."

            pulling our own weight, but this lead to a potential for task overlap and gaps in 
            responsibility. To enhance our workflow, I suggested adopting the Scrum framework for 
            added structure and accountability. We introduced week long sprints, shifting our meetings 
            to focus not only on reviewing completed work but also on setting clear goals and priorities. 
            This adjustment improved coordination, clarified individual roles, and ensured steady 
            progress toward our objectives."

            in normalizing the schema to Boyce-Codd Normal Form and contributed to writing / testing SQL 
            queries. I took the lead on PHP development on the front end, where I built the user-facing 
            interface that interacted with our MySQL database. I also supported the final documentation 
            process, helping write and edit the report. We regularly reviewed each otherâ€™s work to

            our deadlines. Over the six-week project timeline, we created a robust relational model for the 
            database, improving both performance and maintainability. Our normalized database design ensured 
            data integrity and reduced redundancy, resulting in a more efficient system. We also developed a 
            user-friendly web interface and deployed the application on multiple platforms, demonstrating our 
            ability to handle a complex database in web development. Although the application is no longer 
            running on Google Cloud due to a lack of funds, it is successfully hosted on InfinityFree, allowing 
            us to continue showcasing our work. This project not only met the requirements but also enhanced 
            our learning experience, allowing each team member to engage in all aspects of the development process."
